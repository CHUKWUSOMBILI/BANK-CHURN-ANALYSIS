     medium_balance - 58.52%




4. Customer Segmentation & Behavioral Analysis

        2 - 2.95%
        3 - 17.08%
        4 - 10.80%



6. Geographic & Demographic Trends

Is there a significant difference in churn between male and female customers?

Germany - 39.96%

Spain - 20.27%


8. Customer Engagement & Activity Levels

DATA CLEANING:
In the course of analyzing this dataset, the column headings with data type abnormality was altered to the normal data type in SQL. 
-	6 new columns were also added to the table making a sum of 19 columns
-	The data was changed to set sql_safe_updates=0;
-	The data set was checked for duplicates

  

DATA  EXPLORATION : 
The followings were deduced from this analysis
1.A total of 2037 customers ( 20.37%) was churned while 7963 (79.63%) customers are still remaining with the bank. This is significant and suggests a need for addressing retention strategies.
2.The middle aged group had the highest churn rate with 87.09% .This could indicate a specific issue with this group, such as dissatisfaction with services or financial products, that should be investigated further
3. Non- active members exited more than the active members .It might suggest that the bank isnâ€™t sufficiently engaging or providing value to these customers, and outreach strategies could help reduce churn in this group.
4. customers with high credit score exited the company more than other category, this could be as a result of high interest rate on loans and other benefits.
5. Customers with credit card exited more than those without credit card, may indicate issues with credit card services,
6. 55.92% of female customers exited, while 44.04% males exited from the bank. It's worth exploring whether there are specific services or products that are less appealing to female customers, or if there are more personalized outreach efforts needed to retain them.
7. Customers with one product exited more than those with multiple products.his could indicate that customers with only one product are not finding enough value in the bank to stay. Offering additional products that fit their needs could help increase loyalty.
8. 4559(57.25%) male customers are still remaining while 3404(42.75%) females are still remaining with the bank.




RECOMMENDATION: 
1.This firm should regularly solicit and act on customer feedback to continually improve the users experience.
2.This company must continously innovate and differenciate their products and services, providing unique value propositions that competitors can't easily replicate.
3.The company should consider implementing pricing strategies that cater for different customer segments. Offering different pricing options can make the products or services more accessible and reduce the likelihood of customers leaving.
4.continous product improvement and prompt resolution of any issues can maintain customers satisfaction and prevent churn. 
5.The middle-aged customers should be engaged with regular updates, informative and mouth-watering packages to captivate their minds. Offering better loan terms, or other products that appeal to this group, could help retain them.
6.Their should be a robust feed back from all the customers to ascertain their expectations so to know areas and services for improvement.
7.Re-engagement for Non-Active Members: Running campaigns or offering incentives to bring back non-active members could reduce churn in that group.
